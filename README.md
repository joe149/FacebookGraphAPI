# FacebookGraphAPI
This is the project I created in the iOS programming talk

To open it, install XCode on your Mac, and then double click the FacebookGraphAPI.xcworkspace file. It will open in XCode.

Note that I've used CocoaPods (no, not Cocoa Puffs...) to add the Facebook SDK to the XCode project.  That's why we open the 
FacebookGraphAPI.xcworkspace file instead of the FacebookGraphAPI.xcodeproj file.  A simple project would only have the
xcodeproj file.  Cocoapods creates a workspace (which contains multiple projects) to add libraries you specify.

Please let me know if you have any issues with running this!  joe.elwell@gmail.com
